      <h1 id="agile-planning">Agile Planning</h1>
      <h2 id="user-stories">User Stories</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>User stories</strong> are a way to capture requirements in a way
        that is easy to understand and implement.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are typically written from the perspective of the user, and are
        focused on the value they will receive from the feature:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>As a [role], I want to [action] so that [outcome].</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        User stories form a nice communication tool between the client and the
        development team, because they are focused on the value the feature will
        provide rather than the implementation details.
      </p>
      <h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
      <p>
        Identifing roles in the story helps us understand the
        <strong>domain</strong> of the system. We may have multiple types or
        categories of users. By breaking down which type of user is performing
        the action, we can better construct our implementation.
      </p>
      <p>Example Roles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User</li>
        <li>Admin</li>
        <li>Vendor</li>
        <li>Inventory Manager</li>
        <li>Account Manager</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="actions--outcomes">Actions / Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        The action is the verb of the user story, and the outcome is the benefit
        they will receive from the action.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want these to be as simple and concise as possible, while still
        preserving the intent of the story.
      </p>
      <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
      <p>Some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As a user, I want to be able to sign up for an account so that I can
          use the service.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a vendor, I want to be able to enter information for a new product
          so that I can add it to the catalog.
        </li>
        <li>
          As an inventory manager, I want to update monthly stock capacity so
          that I limit warehouse space usage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
      <p>
        After gathering the user stories, we can break them down into tasks that
        are more manageable. These are what&#39;s actually used to track
        progress and work.
      </p>
      <p>Tasks should have the following characteristics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Small:</strong> They should be small and focused, ideally no
          more than a day or two of work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-contained:</strong> They should be complete, such that
          they can be worked on by a single developer without depending on other
          tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Testable:</strong> They should have well-defined success
          criteria.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
      <p><em>Developer Focused Task</em></p>
      <div class="focusContent example">
        <p>
          <strong>Title:</strong> Design User Authentication Database Schema

      <h3 id="common-initial-development-tasks">
        Common Initial Development Tasks
      </h3>
      <p>
        At the start of a new project, many tasks will be focused on how the
        development team will get the project off the ground. These don&#39;t
        fit nicely into user stories, but tracking them is essential to the
        project&#39;s success.
      </p>
      <p>These tasks are often focused on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Technology proof of concepts</li>
        <li>Project scaffolding / initial codebase setup</li>
        <li>Database setup, configuration, initialization, schema design</li>
        <li>Authentication</li>
        <li>User interface design</li>
        <li>Build pipeline configuration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Planning and implementation may be split into separate tasks.</p>
      <h2 id="user-story-vs-use-case">User Story vs Use Case</h2>
      <p>User stories and use cases are similar, but differ in their focus:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          User stories focus on the value the feature will provide to the user.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use cases focus on the sequence of steps (interactions) required to
          complete a task.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="focusContent example">
        <p><strong>User Story:</strong></p>
        <p>
          &quot;As a student, I want to submit my homework online so that I can
          track my work progress electronically.&quot;
        </p>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Student logs into the system</li>
          <li>Student selects their class</li>
          <li>Student uploads their homework file</li>
          <li>System confirms the upload was successful</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h2 id="final-notes">Final Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Having reached this point, we should take another look at the
        <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>, which reminds
        us:
      </p>
      <p>&quot;People and interactions over processes and tools&quot;.</p>
      <p>
        If we find that our processes and tools are getting in the way of our
        people, we should consider whether we are using the right tools for the
        job. This includes the Agile process itself.
