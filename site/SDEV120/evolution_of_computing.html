      <h2 id="early-computing">Early Computing</h2>
      <p>
        Early computers were mechanical. They used gears, levers, and other
        mechanical components to perform calculations. The most famous example
        is the Babbage Difference Engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, vacuum tubes were used to build electronic computers. These were
        large, slow, and unreliable.

        Transistors were invented in 1947. They are the basis of modern
        computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <strong>transistor</strong> is a switch that can be turned on or off
        by applying a small voltage. They form the subcomponents of logic gates.
      </p>
      <p>
        An <strong>integrated circuit</strong>, or is a collection of
        transistors and other components on a single chip. These are often
        referred to as &quot;chips&quot; or &quot;microchips&quot;.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moore&#39;s Law is an observation made by Gordon Moore, co-founder of
        Intel, in 1965. It states that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every
          two years.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Note the specifics - it&#39;s all about how many transistors can be
        packed onto a chip (density of transisitors).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Does this translate to a linear increase in performance every year?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="continued-growth">Continued Growth?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is currently a debate about whether Moore&#39;s Law can
          continue.
        </li>
        <li>
          After a certain point, the size of transistors will be so small that
          quantum effects will start to interfere with their operation - you
          can&#39;t pack the transistors any closer together.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Ray Kurzweil has observed more generally that the rate of change in
        technology is itself accelerating. This is a more general observation
        than Moore&#39;s Law, which is specific to transistors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above we look at how much we can compute with a dollar over time. The
        curve is mildly exponential (curved up), not linear (straight).
      </p>
      <p>
        Kurzweil and others believe that as long as there is a demand for more
        computing power, the technology will continue to evolve to meet that
        demand.
