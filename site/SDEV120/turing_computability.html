        <strong>Computability</strong> refers to ability to solve a problem in a
        finite number of steps.

      <h2 id="alan-turing">Alan Turing</h2>
      <p>
        Alan Turing lived in Britain during World War II. He was a mathematician
        and cryptanalyst. Among his accomplishments are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Helped break the encryption from German &quot;Enigma&quot; machine
          during WWII to decode German messages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Was foundational in showing the limits of what computers can and
          cannot do. In doing so he laid the groundwork for the development of
          modern computing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pioneered the field of artificial intelligence (from which we get the
          &quot;Turing Test&quot;).
        </li>
        <li>
          Worked in biology, specifically in the field of morphogenesis (how
          biological forms develop).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="the-halting-problem">The Halting Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Turing wasn&#39;t trying to build a computer in the modern sense. He was
        working on a math problem that had to do with logical propositions (the
        Entscheidungsproblem, or &quot;decision problem&quot;).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Halting Problem</strong> asks: &quot;Is there a general
        algorithm that can take another algorithm along with its input and
        determine whether the algorithm will halt (stop running) or run
        forever?&quot;
      </p>
      <p><em>Example:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Let&#39;s say we have a program that we know prints ones and/or zeroes
          based on a set of rules and inputs. We want to know if the program
          will ever print a zero. If we give this set of rules and inputs to
          another program, can it determine if the first program will ever print
          a zero?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Turing showed that there are some problems that are fundamentally
        unsolvable by any algorithm in finite time. This is known as the
        <strong>Church-Turing Thesis</strong>.
      </p>
      <h1 id="the-turing-machine">The Turing Machine</h1>
      <p>
        Turing created what we now call the <strong>Turing Machine</strong>: a
        theoretical device that can simulate the logic of any computer
        algorithm. It&#39;s not a physical machine, just a concept.
      </p>
      <p>It consists of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A tape that can be read from and written to, and extended infinitely
          in both directions.
        </li>
        <li>A head that can move left or right along the tape.</li>
        <li>A set of states that the machine can be in.</li>
        <li>A starting state.</li>
        <li>
          A set of rules that determine what the machine does based on its
          current state and the symbol it reads from the tape; basically a
          lookup table to determine what to do next.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Example:</em></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          This machine prints an alternating sequence of zeroes and ones:
          01010101...
        </li>
        <li>Turing always leaves blank squares between the printed symbols.</li>
        <li>
          In this example the &quot;symbol&quot; column in the table are all
          &quot;None&quot;, but for meaningful programs they would be filled
          various symbols that are used to control the calculations.
        </li>

        <li>
          Turing&#39;s oddly mechanistic approach to solving the problem paved
          the way for the development of mechanized computing.
        </li>
        <li>Turing formalized the concept of an algorithm.</li>
        <li>Programs are algorithms.</li>
        <li>We give them inputs and they produce outputs.</li>
