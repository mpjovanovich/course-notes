      <h1 id="prompt-engineering">Prompt Engineering</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong> is the skill of crafting effective
        instructions for LLMs to get the best possible responses. Since LLMs
        predict based on patterns, how you ask matters enormously.
      </p>
      <h2 id="why-prompts-matter">Why Prompts Matter</h2>
      <p>
        LLMs generate responses based on probability distributions learned from
        training data. The exact wording of your prompt influences which
        patterns the model draws from.
      </p>

      <p>
        If something looks wrong or is not working, ask the LLM to reflect on
        its previous responses. It will often notice that it is not following
        the given instructions, or that it has provided faulty information.
