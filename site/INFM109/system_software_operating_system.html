        <p>
          While people would most often say &quot;I use Linux&quot; to indicate
          the operating system they are using, Linux is actually just the system
          software at the core of many different operating systems - the
          <strong>kernel</strong>. The kernel&#39;s job is to manage the
          computer&#39;s resources - memory, CPU time, disk space, and other
          hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          A complete operating system needs more than just resource management -
          it needs user interfaces, utilities (like file managers, text
          editors), device drivers, and other system tools that let users
          actually interact with the computer.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>Key characteristics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Linux kernel is free and open source system software</li>
        <li>
          Runs on almost any hardware, from tiny devices to supercomputers
        </li>
        <li>
          Many different complete operating systems (&quot;distros&quot;) built
          around the kernel

        <li>
          Popular in academia, government, and industry due to stability and

          The many different operating systems that run on the Linux kernel are
          called
          <strong>distributions</strong> or <strong>distros</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a fun rivalry within the Linux community regarding which
          distribution is the best.

        The programs that we use directly are called

        In contrast, operating system software runs in the

        The data from running programs must first be loaded into
        <strong>memory</strong> (RAM) before the CPU can use them, but we
        don&#39;t need to load all of the program into memory at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paging</strong> is a memory management technique that allows the
        OS to load parts of a program into memory at different times:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Programs are split into small, equal-sized chunks called
          &quot;pages&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
          Only the pages that are actively being used are loaded into memory

          Paging works much like taking books from a shelf. If your program is
          an encyclopedia, here&#39;s how the different storage components map
          to real-world objects:

          Swapping pages between RAM and the swap file on disc is an expensive
          operation!
        </p>
        <p>
          When the program spends more time swapping pages than actually
          running, it is said to be <strong>thrashing</strong>.

      <h4 id="virtual-memory">Virtual Memory</h4>
      <p>
        In early computers, programs had to know exactly where their data was
        physically stored in memory. This was a problem because one program
        might accidentally overwrite another program&#39;s data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Virtual memory</strong> creates a simple way for programs to
        work with memory by separating two things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The memory addresses that programs use to access data (virtual
          addresses)
        </li>
        <li>
          The actual physical locations in RAM or on disk (physical addresses)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Each program gets its own set of virtual addresses starting at zero and
        going up in order. The operating system handles converting these virtual
        addresses to real physical locations. This system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lets programs work with memory without knowing where data actually is
        </li>
        <li>Prevents programs from accessing each other&#39;s memory space</li>
        <li>Allows the OS to move data between RAM and disk as needed</li>
        <li>Makes it possible to run programs even when RAM is limited</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In other words, the OS acts as a middleman between the program and the
        physical memory.
      </p>

        <p>
          One of the most important jobs of the OS is to protect the memory of
          one program from another. A user program cannot directly access memory
          - it must request the OS to access memory on its behalf. This is done
          through
          <strong>system calls</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This security system is crucial because malicious programs often try
          to exploit memory access. For example, many damaging computer viruses
          work by attempting to bypass these protections to overwrite the memory
          of other programs with their own code. If successful, they can inject
          malicious instructions into running programs, potentially taking
          control of the system.

        Early operating systems were <strong>single-tasking</strong> - they
        could only run one program at a time. A program may take two minutes to
        run, so the user would have to wait two minutes for the program to
        finish before they could run another program.
      </p>
      <p><em>Solution:</em></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Multitasking</strong> is when the OS switches between programs
        quickly, giving each program a small slice of CPU time to run. This is
        also called <strong>time-sharing</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scheduling</strong> is the process of deciding which program
        should run next.
      </p>
      <p>
        This rapid switching between programs is called
        <strong>context switching</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this happens so fast that it creates the illusion that multiple
        programs are running simultaneously, even if there is only one CPU.

        <h4 id="interleaved-execution">Interleaved Execution</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Iterleaved execution</strong> is a term that describes the way
          that the OS switches between programs quickly. It works on a system of
          <strong>interrupts</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like a student working on homework might be interrupted by a
          phone call, a program might be interrupted by an interrupt signal from
          the OS. This tells it that it&#39;s time to switch to another task.

          Multitasking vs Parallel Processing
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Parallel Processing</strong> is when the OS runs multiple
          programs at the same time. True parallelism is different from
          multitasking - with parallelism multiple operations may be happening
          at any given point in time within the computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          All modern operating systems can now handle both multitasking and
          parallel processing. They do this by using multiple CPUs, and multiple
          cores within a single CPU. Each core might run a different program at
          the same time.

      <p>The OS also manages the input and output devices.</p>
      <p><em>Buffers</em></p>

        </span>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The OS can allocate <strong>buffers</strong> to store data that is being
        transferred between the device and the computer. Buffers are temporary
        &quot;waiting areas&quot; that help manage data flow between components
        that operate at different speeds. They act much like a queue. For
        example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you type quickly on a keyboard, the keystrokes are stored in a
          buffer until the computer is ready to process them
        </li>
        <li>
          When you move your mouse, the cursor location is stored in a buffer
          until the computer is ready to update the screen
        </li>
        <li>
          When reading from a hard drive, data is stored in disk buffers to help
          manage the speed difference between the fast CPU and slower disk
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Device Drivers</em></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Device drivers</strong> are specialized programs that form a
        layer between hardware and the operating system. Their primary purpose
        is abstraction - hiding the complex, device-specific details from the
        rest of the system.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Applications don&#39;t need to know anything about specific hardware
        </li>
        <li>The OS can treat different devices in similar ways</li>
        <li>Hardware can be updated without changing the OS or applications</li>

          A physical disk drive can be divided into multiple logical sections
          called
          <strong>partitions</strong>. Each partition functions as an
          independent storage unit, appearing to the operating system as a
          separate disk drive.
