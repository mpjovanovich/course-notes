      <p>In these notes we will introduce Git as a version control system.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Version control</strong> or
        <strong>source control</strong> allows us (among other things) to be
        able to know what our project looked like at any point in time, e.g.
        last year, by keeping track of all the changes we&#39;ve made to files
        over time.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stores files and their history</li>
        <li>Tracks changes to files over time</li>
        <li>Allow for point in time recovery and comparison</li>
        <li>
          Allows more than one person to work on (or examine) the same file at
          the same time.
        </li>

      <p>
        Git is a <strong>distributed</strong> version control system. The code
        is saves on multiple machines, and every user has a copy of the entire
        history of the project on his or her own computer.
      </p>
      <p>Specifically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Remote</strong>: The main machine that hosts the project.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Local</strong>: Personal machine of a user.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>GitHub.com is the remote that we will use.</p>
      <h4 id="solo-projects">Solo Projects</h4>
      <p>
        For small solo projects, this usually means that there is a copy of the
        project on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your local (personal) machine</li>
        <li>github.com</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="collaborative-projects">Collaborative Projects</h4>
      <p>
        For collaborative projects, this usually means that there is a copy of
        the project on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your local (personal) machine</li>
        <li>The machines of your teammates / coworkers</li>

        Likewise, changes made on the remote repository (e.g. by a teammate) are
        not automatically reflected on a local machine.

        The easiest way to create a new repository is via the GitHub website.
        You can set the visibility and the name of the repository. Both can be

      <p>
        When we want to create a local copy of a remote repository, we use the

      </p>
      <p>We can use this to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a copy of someone else&#39;s work</li>
        <li>Create a local copy of our own project</li>

        You can find the URL to clone a repository by clicking the green

          In your terminal, change to the directory where you want to clone the

      <p>
        After you have cloned a repository, you need a way to keep it up to date
        with the remote repository. For this we use the
        <code>git pull</code> command.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is always a good idea to do before you start working on the project
        to make sure that your local copy is up to date, especially if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You&#39;re working in a team.</li>
        <li>
          You&#39;re working from multiple computers that each have their own
          copy of the repository (e.g. home and work).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="focusContent demo">

      <p>
        Getting our changes from the local machine to the remote machine is a
        little more complicated, but becomes easy once you understand the way
        that Git works.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        We can think of files that are tracked by Git as being in different
        &quot;areas&quot;.
      </p>
      <h3 id="working-directory">Working Directory</h3>
      <p>
        All of the files that you are currently working on comprise your
        <strong>working directory</strong>. Saving files here does not
        automatically track the changes with Git.

      <p>
        When we want to commit changes to the repository, we first add the files
        that we want to commit to the <strong>staging area</strong>. Changes in
        the staging area are tracked by git but are not yet in the local
        repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the staging area is to allow you to group one or more
        changes together before committing them to the local repository as a
        single unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        To add a file to the staging area, we use the
        <code>git add</code> command:

      <p>
        The files in the local repository are the ones that have been committed.
        This does not mean that the files have been pushed to the remote
        repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        To commit the changes in the staging area to the local repository, we
        use the
        <code>git commit</code> command.
      </p>
      <p>
        This command requires a message to be provided between quotes. For
        starter personal projects this may not seem important, but it&#39;s best
        practice to provide a brief but concise message describing the changes
        that were made. The messages are used to quickly identify the changes
        when looking back at the commit history.

      <p>
        Finally, we need to push the changes from the local repository to the
        remote repository. It&#39;s usually best to do this immediately after
        committing the changes to the local repository.
      </p>
      <div class="focusContent demo">
        <p>Here we will:</p>

      <hr />
      <h3 id="file-states">File States</h3>
      <p>
        Each file that is tracked by Git can be in one of four states, which
        roughly correspond to the areas that we discussed earlier:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Unmodified</strong>:</p>
      <p>The file has not been modified since it was last committed.</p>
      <p><strong>Modified</strong>:</p>
      <p>The file has been modified but not yet added to the staging area.</p>
      <p><strong>Staged</strong>:</p>
      <p>The file has been added to the staging area but not yet committed.</p>
      <p><strong>Committed</strong>:</p>
      <p>
        The file has been committed to the local repository (at which point is
        is again &quot;unmodified&quot;).
      </p>
      <div class="focusContent demo">
        <p>Here we will:</p>
        <ul>

      <!-- ## GitHub Codespaces

- **GitHub Codespaces** is a virtual development environment that runs in the browser.
- Run it by clicking the green button in the top right of the repository page:
- Allows you to run VS Code in the browser.
  - Uses https://vscode.dev/ - online IDE

### Creating a Codespace

- To create
  - Go to your repository
  - Click the "Code" button
  - Click the Codespaces tab

### Closing a Codespace

GitHub gives you an allocated amount of minutes to use per month. While active, codespaces will use some of your minutes.

- To close while in the Codespace
  - Bring up the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P`
  - Type `Codespaces: Close Current Codespace`
- To close from the repository page
  - Go to your repository
  - Click the "Code" button
  - Click the Codespaces tab
  - Delete any active codespaces
- To check if you have existing codespaces
  - Go to: https://github.com/codespaces
  - Delete any active codespaces

**As long as your code has been pushed to GitHub, it is safe (and encouraged) to close/delete a codespace whenever you're done with a work session.**

You can always start a new one.

### Checking Your Balance

- Go to https://github.com/settings/billing/summary
- Scroll down to Codespaces:

![GitHub Billing](images/github_codespaces_billing.png)

- Note that hours listed are **core hours**.
- We use 2 core machines, so 1 hour of Codespaces usage is 2 hours of core hours.
- You should have 90 hours of Codespaces usage per month. -->

### VS Code Terminal

#### Terminals and Shells

Git commands are in the form `git [your_command_here] --[optional_flags_here]`.

Git commands are typed into a **terminal** which runs a **shell**.

- A **terminal** provides a user interface into a shell.

  - This is what you type commands into.
  - Like the part of the car that you see and interact with.

- A **shell** is a program that executes text **commands**.

  - This is what actually runs the command.
  - Like the "engine" of a car.
  - Usually use `bash` or `zsh` shells.

The CLI for Git can be accessed in a VS Code terminal:

- `Ctrl + ~` or `View > Terminal`.

Make sure that you are in the root directory of your project:

- Use the `pwd` command to see the current directory.

Make sure that you have the correct shell selected, _bash_ or _zsh_:

### VS Code Source Control Panel

The GUI for Git can be accessed in the VS Code Source Control Panel:

![VS Code Source Control](images/vscode_source_control_1.png)

- The number in the circle indicates the number of files that have been changed.
- A commit message is required before you press the button.

After committing, you can push to GitHub with the Sync button:

- Check the **Pull requests** tab:

![GitHub Pull Requests](images/github_feedback_1.png)

- You will se general comments, and line-by-line comments.
- Comments can also be viewed in a Codespace.
