# Cannonball Demo: Cursor

Write an educational Newtonian mechanics program in html / css / JavaScript that allows the user to enter an angle, force, and cannonball weight using appropriate input controls. The program should calculate the distance that the cannonball travels before hitting the ground.

Please add sensible defaults for the inputs

The styling is pretty bare. Please add internal styles to give it a fun but professional feel.

Cool. Add a reset button please.

Add a minimal animation to show cannonball's path

How can I add values to the x and y axes?
