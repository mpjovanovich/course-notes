# Computer Orientation

## Naming Files and Folders

Spaces and special characters in files and directories can be a cause of bugs, and generally make life more difficult for programmers and technical users.

**Good Habits:**

- Use underscores (`_`) or _CamelCase_ instead of spaces.

## File Extensions

The file extension allows a file to be associated with a specific program. For example:

- `.txt` is associated with a text editor.
- `.html` is associated with a web browser
- `.docx` is associated with Microsoft Word.

You can change the file extension to whatever you want (despite warnings you may receive).

~.focusContent.demo

- Create a new file called `test.txt`.
- Remove the extension.
- Open the file in a text editor.
- It still works!

**Good Habits:**

- Make sure file extensions are visible. Windows hides them by default.
- Be sure to check the file extension prior to saving in a program, such as notepad or Notepad++.

## Directory Structure

- _Directory_ and _folder_ mean the same thing.
- Directories are containers for storing other files.
- They have a hierarchical structure, like a family tree.

~.focusContent.demo

Create the directory structure below:

```
C
├── folder1
│   ├── file1.txt
│   ├── file2.txt
├── file3.txt
├── file4.txt
```

Describe the following:

- Root directory?
- Sibling directories?
- Child directories?
- Parent directories?

/~

**Good Habits:**

- Use a hierarchicial directory structure where possible.
- Use a consistent naming convention.

## Tip: Ctrl / Cmd + f = Find!

Ctrl / Cmd + f is the universal "find" shortcut. It works in broswers, text editors, etc.

If there's something you're looking for, e.g. a homework keyword, try using this shortcut.

## Summary: What Should I Be Able to Do?

- _Easily_ find files and folders on your machine
- Create new files and folders
- Move files and folders
- Delete files and folders
- Rename files and folders
- Change the extension of files
