**Digital Natives** = Born after 1990s. Never experienced a world without computers / Internet.

### Key Changes

1. **Analog to Digital**

   - Transition from physical to digital storage and transmission
   - Examples: vinyl to MP3, film to digital photos, paper to digital documents

2. **Stationary to Mobile**

   - From fixed locations to anywhere access
   - Desktop computers → laptops → smartphones
   - Landline phones → mobile phones → smartphones

3. **Local to Cloud**

   - Shift from local storage to cloud-based services
   - Software installation to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
   - Personal servers to cloud computing

4. **Passive to Interactive Media**

   - One-way broadcast (TV/radio) to interactive content
   - Rise of social media and user-generated content
   - Gaming and interactive entertainment

5. **Privacy Evolution**

   - From relative anonymity to digital footprints
   - Increasing concerns about data privacy and security
