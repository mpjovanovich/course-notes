# Database Storage

A **database** is an organized collection of data along with the systems and methods used to store, manage, and access that data.

It is not a specific type of file or software. There are many different types of databases, each offering different features and capabilities.

## Assignment: Using a Database

In this assignment we will first interface with a database using a GUI (the **front end** of the application).

Then we will use DBMS software to run queries on the database (the **back end** of the application) to perform some analysis.

You will find the instructions on the course website, and your instructor will walk you through the exercise.

# Database Storage

## Database Files vs Text Files

### Text Files

- Human readable
- Unstructured data
- Simple to edit
- No built-in data validation
- Limited search capabilities
- Poor for complex relationships

### Database Files

- Binary format (usually)
- Structured data storage
- Built-in validation rules
- Efficient searching/indexing
- Handles relationships between data
- Transaction support
- Concurrent access control

## SQL vs NoSQL Databases

### SQL (Relational) Databases

- Structured data in tables
- Fixed schema
- Uses SQL language
- ACID compliance
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Best for:
  - Complex queries
  - Transaction-heavy applications
  - Data with clear structure

### NoSQL Databases

- Flexible schema
- Various data models:
  - Document (MongoDB)
  - Key-value (Redis)
  - Column-family (Cassandra)
  - Graph (Neo4j)
- Typically scales horizontally
- Best for:
  - Large amounts of unstructured data
  - Rapid changes in data structure
  - High-speed, simple queries -->
