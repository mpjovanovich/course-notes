# Embedded AI

## Computer Access and Tool Integration

AI is being used more often to produce **artifacts** like code, documents, and presentations.

Additionally, it is being used to **control** other applications and services.

**File Access**:

- Read and analyze documents you upload
- Create and modify files
- Work with spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and other media formats

**Web Integration**:

- Search the internet for current information
- Use multiple sources to compile a summary
- Use user-provided websites as context

**Check Your Sources**:

_When summarizing information, Internet search AIs will provide links to the sources they used. Be sure to check these sources!_

**Using Current Data to Produce Artifacts**:

```
Given the following website:

- https://www.visualcapitalist.com/which-countries-trust-self-driving-cars-the-most/

Please create a data-driven graphic or table that shows how trust in self-driving cars relates to each contry's production of self-driving cars.
```

**Code Execution**:

- Write and run programs
- Perform complex calculations
- Create data visualizations
- Debug and test code

## Best Practices for Tool Use

**Diligence and Awareness**:

- Always review AI-generated content before using it
- Always know what information the AI system has access to
- Always know what the AI system is capable of doing (e.g. executing programs)

**Verification Steps**:

- Check sources and citations independently
- Validate calculations and analysis
- Test generated code in safe environments before production use

**Privacy Protection**:

- Make sure provided information does not contain sensitive personal information
- Be cautious with proprietary business data
- Understand what data the AI system retains

**Human Oversight**:

- **_Maintain final decision-making authority_**
- Don't blindly follow AI recommendations
- Use AI as a tool to augment, not replace, human judgment. Critical thinking skills are weakened when not exercised.
