### Organized Cybercriminal Groups

**Sophistication and organization of cybercrime is increasing.**

Modern cybercrime organizations operate like legitimate businesses:

- Sell services and exploits to the highest bidder
- Use of the dark web for communication and commerce (Bitcoin)
- Employ marketing techniques within criminal communities
- Operate on reputation and trust
- May have specialized roles / subcontractors within groups

Examples of services offered:

- Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)
- Stolen credential marketplaces
- Botnet rental services
- Custom malware development

### Nation-State Actors

Government-sponsored or government-affiliated groups conducting cyber operations for national interests.

- Tend to operate within dedicated organizations
- Long-term strategic objectives
- May launch attacks in times of war or peace

Many governments will also hire out to both legitimate and criminal groups for cyber operations. Governments may hire third-party groups for an attack in order to maintain plausible deniability.

### Insider Threats

Security risks posed by people within the organization who have authorized access to systems and data.

Types of insider threats:

- **Malicious insiders**: Employees who intentionally misuse their access
- **Compromised insiders**: Employees whose credentials have been stolen
- **Negligent insiders**: Employees who inadvertently create security risks

Why insider threats are particularly dangerous:

- Already have legitimate access to systems
- Understand organizational processes and weaknesses
- May have elevated privileges
- Harder to detect than external attacks

### Script Kiddies and Opportunists

Less sophisticated attackers who use existing tools and exploits without deep technical understanding.

Characteristics:

- Limited technical skills
- Use pre-built tools and scripts
- Often motivated by curiosity or desire for recognition
- May cause significant damage despite limited skills
