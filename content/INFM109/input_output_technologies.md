# Input & Output Technologies: Beyond the Basics

## Introduction: The Input/Output Cycle

### The Foundation of Human-Computer Interaction

- **Input:** Entering data into the computer system
- **Processing:** The computer's handling of that data
- **Output:** The production of usable information

### Keyboards

_Why are the Keys this Way?:_

The QWERTY layout was designed in the 1870s to solve a mechanical problem:

When typists hit keys too quickly on early typewriters, the type bars would jam together. The solution was to arrange commonly used letter combinations so their type bars were far apart from each other, reducing the likelihood of jamming.

- One of the first IO devices (before the mouse)
- **Beyond QWERTY:**
  - Why QWERTY persists despite more efficient layouts
  - Dvorak, Colemak, and other alternative layouts

_A Wooden Mouse:_

The first computer mouse was made of wood in the 1960s.

/~

- **Mouse variations:**

  - **_Optical_**: Uses LED light and optical sensor to track movement on most surfaces
  - **_Laser_**: Higher precision tracking using laser technology
    - _Warning: Can be dangerous to eyes - keep away from children and pets_
  - **_DPI (Dots Per Inch)_**:
    - Specification that determines mouse cursor movement sensitivity
    - Higher DPI = faster cursor movement per physical mouse movement
    - Adjustable DPI useful for different tasks (e.g., gaming, precision work, everyday use)

- **Alternative pointing devices:**
  - **_Trackballs_**:
    - Stationary base with moveable ball
    - Benefits: Space-efficient, reduces wrist strain, good for repetitive stress injuries
  - **_Touchpads_**:
    - Multi-touch gesture support (scroll, zoom, rotate)
    - Offer _**gesture**_ support
    - Common in laptops but also available as standalone devices

### Touch Technologies

~.focusContent.note

_Capacitive Touchscreens:_

Most modern touch screens do not respond to pressure. They work by detecting the electrical conductivity of our fingers disrupting the electrical field of the screen.

This kind of screen is called a _**capacitive touchscreen**_.

This explains why your phone doesn't respond well under certain conditions:

- Wearing gloves - gloves insulate the electrical conductivity
- Hands are wet - water insulates the electrical conductivity
- Plastic screen protectors - plastic insulates the electrical conductivity
- Only part of screen works - moisture or pressure around the edges of the screen can disrupt the electrical field

This is why you can't use a capacitive stylus on a capacitive touchscreen.

/~

- **Touch interaction techniques:**
  - Single Tap (select)
  - Double Tap (open)
  - Long Press (context menu)
  - Multi-finger gestures (pinch to zoom, rotate)
  - ...

- **Professional applications:**
  - Graphics tablets
  - Digital annotation and note-taking
  - Digital signatures
- **Practical takeaway:** Handwritten digital notes improve retention compared to typing (research-backed). This also applies to traditional pen and paper note taking.

### Voice and Audio Input

~.focusContent.note

_Voice Recognition:_

With modern voice regognition, devices are more likely to understand you if you speak naturally than if you over-enunciate.

This is due to _**machine learning**_, which teaches computers how to understand based on actual samples of human speech rather than "dissecting" parts of sounds.

The computer takes into account:

- _**Phonetics**_ - the individual sounds of your speech
- _**Prosody**_ - the rhythm and intonation of your speech
- _**Context**_ - the context of words within speech
