# Input & Output Technologies

IO devices go beyond the keyboard, mouse, and screens. Almost all modern technology has some kind of embedded computer system, which relies on input, and responds with output.

- **Input:** Entering data into the computer system
- **Processing:** The computer's handling of that data
- **Output:** The production of usable information

## Input

### Keyboards

_Why are the Keys this Way?:_

The QWERTY layout was designed in the 1870s to solve a mechanical problem:

When typists hit keys too quickly on early typewriters, the type bars would jam together. The solution was to arrange commonly used letter combinations so their type bars were far apart from each other, reducing the likelihood of jamming.

- One of the first IO devices (before the mouse)
- **Beyond QWERTY:**
  - Why QWERTY persists despite more efficient layouts
  - Dvorak, Colemak, and other alternative layouts

- **Specialized keyboards:**
  - Ergonomic designs: Split, contoured, vertical
  - Programmable keys and customization potential

### The Mouse

_A Wooden Mouse:_

The first computer mouse was made of wood in the 1960s.

/~

- **Mouse variations:**

  - **_Optical_**: Uses LED light and optical sensor to track movement on most surfaces
  - **_Laser_**: Higher precision tracking using laser technology
    - _Warning: Can be dangerous to eyes - keep away from children and pets_
  - **_DPI (Dots Per Inch)_**:
    - Specification that determines mouse cursor movement sensitivity; may want higher DPI for precision editing

- **Touchpads**
  - Multi-touch gesture support (scroll, zoom, rotate)
  - Offer _**gesture**_ support
  - Common in laptops but also available as standalone devices

### Touch Technologies

~.focusContent.note

_Capacitive Touchscreens:_

Most modern touch screens do not respond to pressure. They work by detecting the electrical conductivity of our fingers disrupting the electrical field of the screen.

This kind of screen is called a _**capacitive touchscreen**_.

This explains why your phone doesn't respond well under certain conditions:

- Wearing gloves - gloves insulate the electrical conductivity
- Hands are wet - water insulates the electrical conductivity
- Plastic screen protectors - plastic insulates the electrical conductivity
- Only part of screen works - moisture or pressure around the edges of the screen can disrupt the electrical field

This is why you can't use a capacitive stylus on a capacitive touchscreen.

/~

- **Touch interaction techniques:**
  - Single Tap (select)
  - Double Tap (open)
  - Long Press (context menu)
  - Multi-finger gestures (pinch to zoom, rotate)
  - ...

**Quiz:**

List one device aside from computers, tables, and phones that uses touch as an input method.

### Pen Input

</figure>

- **Professional applications:**
  - Graphics tablets
  - Digital annotation and note-taking
  - Digital signatures
- **Practical takeaway:** Handwritten digital notes improve retention compared to typing (research-backed). This also applies to traditional pen and paper note taking.

### Voice and Audio Input

~.focusContent.note

_Voice Recognition:_

With modern voice regognition, devices are more likely to understand you if you speak naturally than if you over-enunciate.

This is due to _**machine learning**_, which teaches computers how to understand based on actual samples of human speech rather than "dissecting" parts of sounds.

The computer takes into account:

- _**Phonetics**_ - the individual sounds of your speech
- _**Prosody**_ - the rhythm and intonation of your speech
- _**Context**_ - the context of words within speech

/~

- **Real-world applications:**
  - Accessibility and convenience features (e.g. voice control)
  - Transcription (e.g. YouTube captions)
  - Linguistic translation

### Video and Imaging Input

_Is it Paranoid to Cover your Webcam?:_

Not according to former FBI Director James Comey.

/~

- **Professional applications:**

  - Video conferencing
  - Baby and pet monitoring
  - Security cameras

- **Other interesting applications:**

  - Plant health monitoring (cameras detect stress before visible to humans)
  - Sleep studies (infrared cameras track movement patterns)
  - Wildlife research (automated species identification)
  - Sports player analysis (facial expressions, movement patterns, stress indicators)
  - Quality control (AI-powered manufacturing inspection)

- **Practical takeaway:** Lighting affects camera quality more than most hardware upgrades. Try adjusting lighting before buying a new webcam.

_From Medicine to Video_

Motion capture, or "mocap," started as a tool for studying human movement patterns and biomechanics, particularly in fields like gait analysis.

/~

- **Common Applications:**
  - Digital animation
  - Medical rehabilitation (Step and limb movement tracking)
  - Security systems (_**LIDAR = Light Detection and Ranging**_)

### Locational Technologies

~.focusContent.note

_Einstein and GPS:_

GPS satellites must account for Einstein's theory of relativity! The satellites' atomic clocks run slightly faster (about 38 microseconds per day) than Earth-based clocks due to weaker gravitational forces in orbit.

Without compensating for this effect, GPS would cause a position error on Earth of about 11 kilometers per day.

/~

- **Global Positioning System (GPS):**

  - Satellite-based navigation
  - Precision within meters
  - Used in navigation, tracking, and timing applications

- **Indoor Positioning Systems:**

  - RFID/NFC - short-range identification (access cards, payments)
  - QR codes - visual scanning for location/information
  - Wi-Fi/Bluetooth - device tracking and navigation

- **Applications:**

  - Navigation and wayfinding
  - Asset tracking (shipping, fleet tracking, inventory, etc.)
  - Location-based services (recommendations, etc.)
  - Emergency response (search and rescue, COVID-19 contact tracing)
  - Geofencing

~.focusContent.note

_What is Geofencing?:_

_**Geofencing**_ creates a virtual boundary around a geographic area. When a device enters or leaves this boundary, it can trigger specific actions. For example:

- A store might send you a coupon when you walk nearby
- Your smart thermostat could adjust the temperature when you get home
- Parents can get alerts if their child leaves a designated safe zone
