# Agentic AI

**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems that can take actions beyond just generating text responses. These systems can use tools, access files, browse the web, and execute code to complete complex tasks.

## Beyond Chat

Traditional chatbots can only respond with text. Agentic AI systems can:

**File Access**:
- Read and analyze documents you upload
- Create and modify files
- Work with spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and other formats

**Web Integration**:
- Search the internet for current information
- Visit specific websites and extract information
- Verify facts against multiple sources

**Code Execution**:
- Write and run programs
- Perform complex calculations
- Create data visualizations
- Debug and test code

**Tool Usage**:
- Access specialized software and APIs
- Integrate with productivity tools (calendars, email, etc.)
- Control other applications and services

### Examples of Agentic Capabilities

**Research Assistant**:
- Search for recent articles on a topic
- Read and summarize multiple sources
- Create a comprehensive report with citations

**Data Analysis**:
- Load a spreadsheet with sales data
- Calculate trends and statistics
- Generate charts and visualizations
- Identify patterns and insights

**Content Creation**:
- Research a topic online
- Create an outline based on findings
- Write content with current information
- Format and export to desired file type

**Problem Solving**:
- Analyze error messages or technical issues
- Search for solutions online
- Test potential fixes
- Provide step-by-step troubleshooting

## Safety Considerations

With expanded capabilities comes increased responsibility and risk.

### What to Verify

**Information Accuracy**:
- AI can still hallucinate facts, even when using tools
- Cross-reference important information from multiple sources
- Be especially careful with recent events or specialized knowledge

**Web Sources**:
- AI may access unreliable websites
- Check the credibility of sources AI cites
- Look for authoritative, well-established sources

**File Operations**:
- Review files before sharing or submitting
- Check calculations and data analysis
- Ensure privacy-sensitive information is handled appropriately

### Access Limitations

**What AI Cannot Access**:
- Private accounts without explicit permission
- Confidential databases or systems
- Real-time systems that could cause harm
- Personal information about individuals

**What AI Should Not Do**:
- Make financial transactions
- Send emails or messages without review
- Modify important systems or settings
- Access sensitive personal data

### Best Practices for Safety

**Verification Steps**:
1. Always review AI-generated content before using it
2. Check sources and citations independently
3. Test code in safe environments before production use
4. Validate calculations and analysis

**Privacy Protection**:
- Don't share sensitive personal information
- Be cautious with proprietary business data
- Understand what data the AI system retains
- Use appropriate privacy settings

**Human Oversight**:
- Maintain final decision-making authority
- Don't blindly follow AI recommendations
- Use AI as a tool to augment, not replace, human judgment
