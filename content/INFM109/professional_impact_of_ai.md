# Professional Impact of AI

AI is rapidly changing the technology workforce.

## Professional Trends

Closest analogy:

- The Industrial Revolution saw machines replace manual/mechanical tasks that can be automated
- The AI Revolution will see machines replace repetitive "thinking and computing" tasks that can be automated

**Job Augmentation**:

- AI will likely augment (assist) rather than replace most jobs, but we will see some job loss during the paradigm shift
- Humans will continue to drive vocational processes toward their intended goal; AI don't have motivations, they are tools

**Industry Changes**:

- Faster prototyping and development cycles for products and services
- More personalized customer experiences (micro-targeting)
- Data becomes even more commoditized (able to be bought and sold)

## AI in a Learning Setting

Recent study (January 2026) shows a _net negative_ impact from AI use for college learning.

- Use human curated (traditional) learning resources as a primary source of information
- Use AI to ask follow up questions and help fill in the gaps

## Preparing for an AI-Integrated Future

**Skills to Develop**:

- Understanding of capabilities and limitations
- Effective **communication, collaboration, and language skills**
- Critical thinking and verification skills; "why did I get this response, and is it trustworthy?"

**Mindset Shifts**:

- Focus less on job titles and more on ability to quickly learn new skills
- Stay curious, flexible, and adaptable as jobs change rapidly
