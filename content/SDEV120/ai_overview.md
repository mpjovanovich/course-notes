# Artificial Intelligence

<!-- TODO: split into several pages -->

These notes are a mess, as I'm currently porting them from:

  - Open vs closed source
  - Who owns the training data? Can you train from artists' or researchers' work?
  - Where does the data "live"?

## Types of AI

### Expert Systems

Simulate human intelligence...

- Are a form of AI.
  - _No active learning by machine_.
  - _Rely upon predefined rules_.

- **_Frequent firing of a neuron strengthens the synapse between connected neurons._**
  - Synaptic distance decreases; "tighter" connection along circuit.
  - Close synapses are more likely to fire together.
  - Aids in memory formation.

#### Artificial Neural Networks

- Inputs are called "features" or "parameters"
- Each layer behaves like a function, transforming the previous layer.
- Complexity of function that can be learned depends on the architecture thatâ€™s used.

##### Single layer perceptron

<!-- https://towardsdatascience.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-neural-networks-and-backpropagation-machine-learning-made-easy-e5285bc2be3a -->

- What can it compute?
  - Linear functions - where output groupings (true or false) can be separated by a line.
  - E.g. AND - yes; XOR - no

### Potential Entrants to AI

- **_Barriers to entry_** = factors that make it difficult for new competitors to enter the market.
  - Capital
    - Can't raise initial funding to start
  - Expertise
    - Can't afford to hire experts
  - Monopoly
    - Supply locked
    - Can't compete with prices
    - Can't compete with branding

<p class="demo">Case study:</p>

**nVidia and GPU Market**

- Industries scrambling to create/employ AI plan
- Huge demand, low supply
- Rivalry / competitors in ramp up mode
- Who profits?

  - Are these profits tenable long term?

- Currently, there are linear profits for linear scaling in compute
- Will there be a "compute bust"?
- Responses to need for massive compute power...
  - Efficient algorithms
  - Compression

<p class="demo">Case study:</p>

**AI Software and Hardware Architechtures**

- Started off niche
- Odd position where "products" are not yet defined;
  - Exploritory investment
- Major tech leaders, e.g. Meta, now open sourcing how to do things
- How does this influence barrier to entry?
  - Startups?
  - Good or bad for innovation?

## Staying Current on Innovation

Technical skills must be supplemented with knowledge of current trends and innovations.

- MS Build convention, Satya Nadella and others, Microsoft... find something interesting!
