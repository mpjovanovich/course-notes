# Coding Environments

A **text editor** is a type of program used for editing plain text files.

Good for simple programs when debugging is not necessary.

May or may not offer syntax highlighting.

_Examples:_

- **Notepad**
- **Notepad++**
- **TextEdit**
- **nano**
- **vi** / **vim**
- **emacs**
- **gedit**
- **Sublime Text**
- **Atom**

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

~~fig(80){images/vs_code.PNG}

An **integrated development environment (IDE)** is a software application used to develop software.

More complex than a text editor.

_Examples:_

- **VS Code**
- **Visual Studio**
- **Eclipse**
- **NetBeans**
- **IntelliJ IDEA**
- **PyCharm**
- **Xcode**
- **Android Studio**

### Features

The following features are common in IDEs. Some text editors may also offer these features.

#### Syntax Highlighting

**Syntax highlighting** displays code in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms.

Makes the code much easier to read.

#### Auto-Formatting

**Auto-formatting** automatically indents and formats code.

#### Code Completion

**Code completion** automatically suggests code as you type.

#### Debugging

**Debugging** is the process of finding and resolving defects or problems within the program.

A **debugger** is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs. IDEs usually include a debugger.

- Step through code
- Set breakpoints
- Inspect variables
- Watch expressions

#### Version Control Integration

**Version control** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

**Git** is a popular version control system.
