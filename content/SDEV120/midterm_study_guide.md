# Midterm Study Guide

## Not Covered

M04: Intro to Programming

## Covered

Everything else.

### M01

#### Algorithms

- What is an algorithm?
- What are algorithms used for in computing?
- What are the three elements of structured programming?

#### Pseudocode

- What is it?
- Why is it used?
- Basic guidelines for writing pseudocode
- Given some pseudocode - follow it and determine the output

#### Flowcharts

- Know the symbols
- Given a flowchart - follow it and determine the output

### M02

#### Terms

- Proposition
- Logical connective
- Unary operator
- Binary operator
- Negation (logical NOT)
- Conjunction (logical AND)
- Disjunction (logical OR)
- Exclusive OR (logical XOR)

#### Logical operators

- Know the mathematical symbols (∨, ∧, ¬, ⊕)
- Know order of operations

#### Truth tables

- Be able to create truth table for three basic logical operators
- Given some statement, express with propositions and connectives (e.g. "Jonny is either a cat or a dog.")
- Be able to plug propositions into a truth table and determine the output (like problems 3 and 4 on the homework)

#### Misc

- DeMorgan's Laws: how to distribute negation over conjunction and disjunction
- Modulo operator: be able to solve basic problems (5 % 2 = 1, 7 % 10 = 7)
- Decision trees: given some tree and a set of inputs, be able to determine the leaf node that is reached

### M03

- What is a logic gate?
- What is the difference between analog and digital signals?
- What kinds of things can logic gates and circuits be used for in computing?
  - _Dont have to know specific circuit names and patterns, but should know what they are used for._
- What is the computer clock?
- What is a clock cycle, and how does it relate do the rising and falling edges of a clock signal?
- Given a circuit consisting of logic gates, be able to determine the output given a set of inputs; will the light turn on?
  - _The gates will be labeled (AND, OR, NOT). You do not have to memorize the symbols for these gates, but you should know what they do._

### M05

#### Terms

- Syntax
- Literal
- Variable
- Operator
- Operand

_Other:_

- What's the difference between a statement (it does something) and an expression (it returns something)?

#### Trees

- Know terms: node, root, leaf, parent, child
- How does the post-order traversal algorithm work?
  - Given some tree - In what order are nodes visited?

#### Abstract Syntax Trees

- What is an abstract syntax tree?
- Given some tree, what is the expression that it represents?
- Given some expression, how would you draw a tree?
  - If there is a function in the tree, how do you expand it?

#### Algebraic Functions

Be able to evaluate:

- Composed functions, e.g. f(g(x))
- Functions with multiple arguments, e.g. f(x, y)
- Functions with boolean logic, e.g. f(x, y, z) = x AND y OR z

### M06

#### SDLC

- What is the software development life cycle?
- What are three main paradigms for SDLC models, and what is meant by each?
  - Linear
  - Iterative
  - Continuous

#### UML

- What is UML?
- In what scenarios would UML documentation be appropriate?
- For the five diagrams that we covered, what is the purpose of each?
  - Class diagram
  - Use case diagram
  - Sequence diagram
  - Activity diagram
  - State diagram

## Final Notes

- For all above: You don't have to know anything Python specific, just general concepts.

- You won't be able to leave the room during the exam, so make sure you prepare accordingly.

- Bring a pen / pencil. I'll have paper for in-person. Remote students may use own blank paper.

_Double check what the question is asking for._
