> Bertrand Russell, in a lecture on logic, mentioned that in the sense of material implication, a false proposition implies any proposition.

> A student raised his hand and said "In that case, given that 1 = 0, prove that you are the Pope."
>
> Russell immediately replied, "Add 1 to both sides of the equation: then we have 2 = 1. The set containing just me and the Pope has 2 members. But 2 = 1, so it has only 1 member; therefore, I am the Pope."

## Implication Truth Table (reminder):

| p   | q   | p → q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| T   | T   | T     |
| T   | F   | F     |
| F   | T   | T     |
| F   | F   | T     |

## Contrapositive

We form the contrapositive of a proposition by negating both the antecedent and the consequent, and then switching them.

The contrapositive of `p → q` is `¬q → ¬p`.

The contrapositive of a proposition is logically equivalent to the original proposition.

## Inverse

We form the inverse of a proposition by negating both the antecedent and the consequent.

The inverse of `p → q` is `¬p → ¬q`.

### Fallacy

A common logical fallacy is to assume that the inverse of a proposition is true.

Example:

- If it is raining, then the ground is wet.
- It is not raining, so the ground is not wet.

Nope! Could be dew, a sprinkler, etc.

## Converse

We form the converse of a proposition by switching the antecedent and the consequent.

The converse of `p → q` is `q → p`.

### Fallacy

A common logical fallacy is to assume that the converse of a proposition is true.

Example:

- If it is raining, then the ground is wet.
- The ground is wet, so it must be raining.

Don't think so!

## Translating Verbal Statements

Translate the following verbal statements into logical arguments, and construct truth tables for each:

- If the moon is made of green cheese, then I will eat it.
- If I eat the moon, then I will not be hungry.
- If an animal is a kangaroo, then it is a mammal.
- If kangaroos are reptiles, then they lay eggs.
- If I finish my work and chores, then I can go to the zoo.
- If I do not finish my work and chores, then I cannot go to the zoo.
- If I am over 18 or I have parental consent, then I can get a tattoo.
- If it's (either) raining and I have an umbrella, or it's sunny, then I'll go for a walk.
