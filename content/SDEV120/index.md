Discussion: Intro to Logic

<!--

SOLUTIONS:

Tips:

- Start by picking a character and assuming they're telling the truth.
- Eliminate roles as they are taken.
- If you hit a logical contradiction then try the next character, assuming that he/she is telling the truth.
- Continue until you find an answer without contradictions.

1)

Assume J = True

J = Kni, B = Spy, G = Kna

If you were to ask G, he would not actually tell you what he told you that he would tell you... he knows he's lying. So this answer is logically consistent.

2)

Assume B = T

J = Kna, B = Kni, G = Spy

3)

Assume Ely = T

Ely = Kni, B = Spy, Ell = Knave
