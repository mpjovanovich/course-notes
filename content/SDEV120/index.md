Discussion: Intro to Logic

<!--

SOLUTIONS:

Tips:

- Start by picking a character and assuming they're telling the truth.
- Eliminate roles as they are taken.
- If you hit a logical contradiction then try the next character, assuming that he/she is telling the truth.
- Continue until you find an answer without contradictions.

1)

Assume J = True

J = Kni, B = Spy, G = Kna

If you were to ask G, he would not actually tell you what he told you that he would tell you... he knows he's lying. So this answer is logically consistent.

2)

Assume B = T

J = Kna, B = Kni, G = Spy

3)

Assume Ely = T

Ely = Kni, B = Spy, Ell = Knave

<!--

TODO NEXT COURSE RUN

- Add table classes to make binary and hex topics easier to understand.
  - Positional notation / weights still not clear to many students.
- Fix truth tables assignment again? Split into pieces.
- Quiz for function composition and function basics. Many students still missed this.
