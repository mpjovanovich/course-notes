# SDEV 265

---

<blockquote>     
    I chanced upon an ancient cache of code:       <br />
    a stack of printouts, tall as any man,         <br />
    that in decaying boxes had been stowed.        <br />
    Ten thousand crumbling pages long it ran.      <br />
    Abandoned in the blackness to erode,           <br />
    what steered a ship through blackness to the moon. <br />
    The language is unused in this late year.      <br />
    The target hardware, likewise, lies in ruin.   <br />
    Entombed within one lone procedureâ€™s scope,    <br />
    a line of code and then these words appear:    <br />
                                                  <br />
    <tt># TEMPORARY, I HOPE HOPE HOPE</tt>         <br />
                                                  <br />
    The code beside persisting to the last&mdash;<br />
    as permanent as aught upon this sphere&mdash;<br />
    while overhead, a vacant moon flies past.      <br />
</blockquote>
