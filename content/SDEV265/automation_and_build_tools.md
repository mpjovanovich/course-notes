# Automation and Build Tools

~.focusContent.lookout

Although there may be some initial overhead, the from the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) teams finds that:

1. Test automation is consistently associated with high-performing teams.
1. Shift-left testing practices (which include unit testing early in development) correlate with improved performance metrics including lead time, deployment frequency, and mean time to recovery.
1. High-performing teams make testing a first-class citizen in their development process rather than treating it as an afterthought.
1. Technical practices like TDD and continuous testing correlate with both improved team performance and reduced burnout.

Testing should be a priority, not an afterthought!
