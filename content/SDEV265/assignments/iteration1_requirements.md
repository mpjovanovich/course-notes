## Assignment Description

There are many effective ways to organize and track requirements. In this assignment, we will use _GitHub Projects_ to create a product backlog and a sprint backlog. This will allow us to track and manage requirements for our project in a way that aligns with Agile development practices.

Your **repository** contains your product code, while the **project** refers to your GitHub project board where we'll manage the work.

_Reference:_

It may be helpful to view the following video before attempting the assignment. The interface has changed slightly since the video was made:

## Instructions

### A. Create GitHub Project

1. From your product repository, navigate to the projects tab and create a GitHub project.
   1. Title your project appropriately.
   1. Use the "table" template.
   1. Make sure that your new project is set to public visibility. This can be changed in the project settings. In practice, most project boards would likely be private. We are making it public so that you can showcase your experience building a project board.

### B. Configure Home Tab

1. Rename the starting tab on the table to "Home"
1. Create a new label for "user story". You will have to do this from your repository page, not the project board.
1. Show the "Labels" column on the home tab of your project (click the + button on the header row).
1. Create a new column for the "Home" view of the project (click the + button on the header row).
   1. Name this column "Priority".
   1. Set the field type to "Single select".
   1. Add options for "Critical", "High", "Medium", and "Low".
   1. Set a color scheme for the new options (click the context menu for the column and selecting "Edit values...).
1. Create a new column for the "Home" view of the project (click the + button on the header row).
   1. Name this column "Level of Effort".
   1. Set the field type to "Single select".
   1. Add options for "High", "Medium", and "Low".
   1. Set a color scheme for the new options (click the context menu for the column and selecting "Edit values...).

### C. Add User Stories

1. Create at least five issues for your user stories to form your initial product backlog.
   1. Type # in a new row and select your repository to link the issue.
   1. Write a brief but descriptive title for the issue.
   1. In the details pane, document the scenario using this format:
      1. Title
      1. Description
      1. Success Criteria
      1. Implementation Notes
   1. Tag the issues with the label “user story”.
   1. Assign a priority to the issue. Make at least one high, one medium, and one low priority item.
   1. Assign an estimated level of effort to the issue.
   1. Assign the issue to a developer.

### D. Create Sprint Tab

1. Create a new view for your project (a new tab from under the project top level page).
1. Title the view “Sprint [current date]”, subbing in the current date.
1. Using the dropdown arrow, change the layout to “Board”.
1. Create or edit the columns so that you have one for each of the following:
   1. Backlog
   1. In Development
   1. Ready to Test
   1. Done
1. Place some of your user stories in the "Backlog" column, and some in the "In Development" column.

## Deliverable

N/A. Your instructor should be a collaborator on your GitHub organization and will be able to view your project board.
