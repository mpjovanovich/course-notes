# Feature Scoping and Analysis

Software features aren't built in isolation. Before writing code, developers benefit from up front analysis - even for the most seemingly simple projects.

~.focusContent.note

More than likely, all of us will build software for someone else at some point in our career.

It may not seem like software development is about business, but if hired to build a product, it's our ethical responsibility to understand the business impact of the features we're building to the best of our ability.

Don't be afraid to ask "non-technical" questions that will help you put requirements in context! This will lead to better software, and happier customers.

## Key Questions for Analysis

When scoping features, ask:

- What problem does this solve?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What are the must-have vs. nice-to-have components?
- What could go wrong?
- What are the maintenance implications?
- How will we measure success?

## Impact Assessment

- User value: Who benefits and how?
- Business impact:
  - Revenue
  - Cost savings
  - Competitive advantage
- Technical impact:
  - System architecture
  - Performance
  - Scalability
- Operational impact:
  - Deployment
  - Monitoring, support needs

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Technical dependencies:
  - Libraries
  - APIs
  - Services
- Data requirements:
  - Schema changes
  - Migrations
  - New data flows
- Infrastructure needs:
  - Compute resources
  - Storage
  - Networking

## Implementation Complexity

- Development effort:
  - New vs. familiar technologies
- Testing requirements:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - User acceptance
- Security considerations:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Data privacy
- Documentation needs:
  - API docs
  - User guides
  - Deployment instructions

## Cross-cutting Concerns

- Logging
- Monitoring
- Backup/recovery
- Compliance requirements
- Accessibility needs

## Maintenance Implications

- Future extensibility
- Technical debt
- Upgrade paths
- Support burden

**Case Study: User Authentication**

Initial request: "Add user login to our web application"

_Surface requirements:_

- Login form
- Password storage
- Session management

_Hidden complexity:_

- Password policy enforcement
- Password reset flow
- Account lockout protection
- Session management
- Authentication based page redirects
- Multi-factor authentication
- Security logging
- Multi-device login handling
- Database schema changes
- ...
