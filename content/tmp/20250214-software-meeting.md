# Software Development Program Review, 2025-02-14

## Part 1: Program Implementation Review

### Course Pacing and Scheduling

**Discussion Focus:** Understanding cross-campus approaches to manage:

- Enrollment volatility
- Resource allocation
- Program tracks

Reference Materials:

- [Software Development AAS Requirements](https://catalog.ivytech.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=9&poid=7887&returnto=1110)
- [Lafayette Scheduling Implementation](https://mpjovanovich.github.io/ivy-sdev-aas-walkthrough/)

**Lafayette Context:**

- Currently offering AAS in Software Development via TC in web
- Single track implementation due to faculty bandwidth
- Potential impacts from cross-campus enrollment

**Open Discussion Points:**

1. Track formalization approaches across campuses
2. Pre/post-pandemic expectations for program offerings
3. Status of 1-credit hour requirement (accreditation, enrollment)
4. Cross-campus enrollment coordination
5. Resource allocation strategies
6. Course offering conflicts (e.g., DBMS 110 impact)

### Teaching and Assessment Methods

**Discussion Focus:** Sharing effective practices for:

- Virtual vs. in-person delivery
- Lab implementation
- Academic integrity

**Topics for Exchange:**

1. In-person vs. LA delivery mix
2. Student return-to-classroom initiatives
3. Performance data: in-person vs. virtual performance gap for LA
4. Lab time utilization strategies
5. Current academic integrity approaches
6. Experience with tools (ZyLabs, etc.)

**GitHub Submission Concerns:**

- In many course shells students currently forced to expose public repositories, not understanding the ramifications.
- PRs cannot be used to provide instructor feedback for public repositories.
- URL submission is messy and error prone.

_Suggestion:_ For assignments in the format: "Submit a link to your GitHub repo", switch to GitHub Classrooms.

## Part 2: Modernization Proposal

### The Case for Change

**Current Challenges:**

- Feedback largely based on "group of experts" review
- Feedback systems are reactive and delayed
- Quality control is manual and inconsistent
- Course improvements are disconnected from real-time student experience

**Vision:** Apply software engineering principles to course development and delivery

### Proposed Modern Workflow

~.focusContent.example

1. **Continuous Feedback**

   - GitHub issues tracking (or similar) from students and instructors
   - Direct coupling between feedback and course iterations
   - Transparent change management and auditing trail

2. **Quality Control Pipeline**

   - Version-controlled course content where possible (e.g. GitHub organization)
   - Small teams with authority to make limited changes
   - Quality control checkpoints (integration test - someone other than author must complete assignment, another must grade)
   - 8-week improvement cycles
   - Case for major revision is more tightly coupled with feedback.
