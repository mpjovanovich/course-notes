# Exercise: Data Journeys

We will perform this exercise in groups starting with this file: [dbms110_input_transform_output](dbms110_input_transform_output.excalidraw).

## Instructions

- Open [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and open the file from above.
- Each group will think of an application that uses the a data journey.
- You will create a share link (top right corner) and share it with the each other.
- Drag and drop components to model a data journey.
  - If you don't see a component that you need, you can create a new one.
  - Feel free to copy/paste and double click to edit text for the existing components.
  - You don't have to use all components, and may not use all of the bins.
- Draw arrows between the components to show the data journey, and label the arrows with the data that is being passed between the components.
- Export the file in SVG format and submit for your homework.
- Reconvene with the class and share your link with the instructor. We will review the data journeys and discuss the components.

## Considerations

After the exercise, consider the following:

- Which components did not fit neatly into the given bins?
- In what data journeys might you have data passed among various parts of the system (all internal to the system)?
- In what data journeys might you have multiple sources updating the same data?
