# Data and Information

## Information vs Data

When contrasted with information, data is best thought of as **raw data** - it is not processed in any way. It is simply the underlying "pieces" that make up information.

**Information** is the processed data. It is the data that has been organized and interpreted in a way that is meaningful to someone.

~.focusContent.example

Take the statement "Ivy Tech currently has 1000 SDEV students." This is information.

The data that makes up this information is:

- "Student A is enrolled in the Fall 2025 semester in the SDEV program."
- "Student B is enrolled in the Fall 2025 semester in the SDEV program."
- ...

Or to look at this in even more detail:

- "Student A is an Ivy Tech student."
- "Student A is enrolled in the Fall 2025 semester."
- "Student A is enrolled in the SDEV program."

As we take the data points and relate them to each other, we can begin to form information.

## Information Systems

An **information system** is a system that collects, stores, and processes data to create information. It's simply a way to draw a boundary around some context.

These information systems often encompasa a **domain** - a specific area of interest.

Examples might be:

- A government agency (e.g. IRS)
- A retail store (e.g. Walmart)
- A college
  - A department within the college (e.g. Human Resources)
  - A school within the college (e.g. School of Business and Information Technology)
- ..

## How Data is Used

We will talk much about databases in the course, but for now let's talk about how data comes into and flows through an information system.

There are three main operations that data goes through in an information system:

- **Input** - Data is collected from a source and _added_ to the information system, or existing data is _updated_.
- **Processing** - Data is _transformed_ into information.
- **Output** - Information is _presented_ to the user.

It's often easier to think backwards from the output. Think of some information systems:

- How do you see the output (usually on your computer or device somewhere)?
- Where did the data in this system initially come from?
- How might it have been processed / transformed to get to the output?

\*Note: Information systems can take many forms. They may not be the traditional computer that you're used to!
