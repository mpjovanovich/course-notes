# NoSQL Databases

**NoSQL** database is a term that generally refers to a database that is not the traditional relational model. It does not mean that SQL is not used. You may hear it referred to as "not only SQL".

We will look at four types of NoSQL databases:

- [Key-Value Databases](key_value_databases.html)
- [Document Databases](document_databases.html)
- [Column Store Databases](column_store_databases.html)
- [Graph Databases](graph_databases.html)
