# Set Basics

<!--

- Definition
- Use excalidraw, but can write on screen with finger
- Set notation (very basic)
- Sets and subsets
    - Example: Let A = colors, B = primary colors
    - Side note: Proper subset vs subset
- Venn diagrams
    - Example: Let A = animals that live in water, B = mammals
- Why this matters for SQL (Result sets)
    - Tables are sets
    - We will eventually be operating on multiple tables at once based on how they overlap
