## Web IDEs vs IDE Integration

**Web interfaces** like ChatGPT or Claude are useful to generate snippets or ask questions about techniques:

- I'm trying to build a program that...
  - What technologies are best suited for this?
- Can you help me understand best practices for... (e.g.)
  - Error handling
  - Unit testing
  - Security
- Can you show me an example of [X programming problem] solved with [Y technology]?

AI **IDE Integration** is better for writing code iteratively:

- Ask AI about your specific codebase / solution
- Ask to generate some functionality
- Ask about errors coming from your codebase
- Ask about best practices for your codebase

## Tips for Prompting

Now that you know the fundamentals of coding, start using AI to help you write code.

- Don't ask for the entire program at once.
  - Try to come up with a "shell" program, ask AI if you're on the right track
  - Tell it to give you only the piece that you want; work incrementally
  - Commit changes to git after each step; AI can often change your code in places that you might not catch.
- Ask it to explain the code that it writes.
- Ask if code follows good coding practices.
- Test thoroughly

**_Don't accept AI suggestions without review!_**

### Exercise:

In this exercise you will use AI to help you write a "flashcard" style software terminology program that helps you understand terminology that is appropriate for students who have completed an "Introduction to Programming" course. The program does not need a GUI (unless you want to make one). You may use any technologies you want.

This is the only guidance you will receive. How you choose to implement it is up to you.

## Essential Skills for the Modern Software Developer

- **Communicating** with people.
  - Clients / stakeholders
  - Team members
- **Communicating** with AI models
  - Prompting
  - Tech literacy and _vocabulary_
- **Learning** at a rapid pace
  - Technology half life currently ~18 months
  - New skill sets
  - New technologies
  - New tools
- **Redefining** your role
  - Traditional "titles" are becoming obsolete
  - Pick out unchanging interests and strengths and define yourself by those; this way your situation might change, but your identity doesn't

## Final Course Takeaways

- Be a **_problem solver_**, not a **_programmer_**
- Start using AI, but don't skip out on learning how to read and write code.
- Stay optimistic, and keep building things!
