# Mid-term Review of Concepts

## Code Formatting

Review: How to autoformat code

## Application Structure

- Scripts vs applications
- Any non-trivial application should be in its own directory

## Classes and Program Flow

- Relationship between Main and supporting classes

  - Classes:
    - Encapsulate some logic that "goes together"
    - Bundled units of code to handle related functionality.
    - Some are more object-like. Others are "utility classes".
  - Main class = program flow of execution logic. Used only to start the program.

## Development Tests

- We're not using unit tests formally, but we should still be writing development tests.
- Writing small functions makes testing easier.
- We then write functions to test other functions.
- At minimum, make sure outcomes are as expected for:
  - Expected results of logical paths through code
  - Error handling

## Bringing It All Together - Walkthrough

- Walkthrough sln to book exercise 20.11 (with tests!)
  - [Java Developer Testing Examples](https://github.com/mpjovanovich/java-developer-testing-examples)

## Closing Announcements

- Allow resubmits for M04 and forward assignments through Friday night.

- Review "Finalized" final project requirements
  - How to add collaborator on GitHub
